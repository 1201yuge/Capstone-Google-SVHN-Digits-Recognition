# Capstone-Google-SVHN-Digits-Recognition

Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree Capstone Project

**Objective**: *Build a live camera app that can interpret number strings in real-world images.*

In this project, you will train a model that can decode sequences of digits from natural images, and create an app that prints the numbers it sees in real time. You may choose to implement your project as a simple Python script, a web app/service or an Android app (highly recommended).

## Setup

Recommended setup for a simple Python script or web app/service:

- Python
- NumPy, SciPy, iPython
- [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)™
- (Optional) OpenCV / SimpleCV / pygame (to capture camera images)

(Optional) For deploying the model in an Android app:

- Android SDK & NDK (see this [README](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/tensorflow/examples/android/README.md))

## Data

[Street View House Numbers (SVHN)](http://ufldl.stanford.edu/housenumbers/): A large-scale dataset of house numbers in Google Street View images.
